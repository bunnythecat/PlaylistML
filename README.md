# Overview
## E2E Musical Recommendation System
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective tools for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have recently attracted a lot of interest for their potential in Recommendation Systems (RS). 
This project focuses on developing an E2E musical recommendation using tools such as the autoregressive language model. So far, we have trained and implemented an autoregressive language model
on the [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge). The model was then built with BentoML to achieve the Backend Service. Frontend was built with Streamlit.
